# ReAccess
restrict access by region in AWS

## It is an idea for now!!
Trying to create something that will restrict access to a region in AWS. 

This is observed that in AWS you cannot restrict access by region. Aim is:
1. To create something that can restrict access
2. Should be managable by the admin
3. Region can be assigned to members.

Note: This idea is only applicable for aws console at the moment with current idea.
